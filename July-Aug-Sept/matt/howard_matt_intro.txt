It is with great pride that I announce joining the team of Musikant, Kase and Dukoff. For me it feels like a home coming, having worked with Dr. Musikant years ago.My ability to work with the team and the referring doctors has always been great. Above all my patient management is what got me back here.

I received my DMD degree from the University Of Pennsylvania. I did a General Practice Residency in New York and returned to U of P to get my certificate in Endodontics. I have been practicing on Long Island and I am eager to return to Manhattan on a more permanent basis.
