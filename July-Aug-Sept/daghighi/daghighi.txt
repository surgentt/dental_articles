Does size of periapical lesion affect the 

prognosis? A case report.

Many factors can affect the prognosis of a root canal (ability to clean and shape the system mechanically and chemically, ability to seal the system, coronal seal, just to name a few). But for this study, I’d like to focus on the size of periapical lesions, and their affect on the overall success of the operation. 

The images below illustrate a case complicated by a large periapical lesion that responded well to non-surgical root canal retreatement. The procedure was completed in two visits:

As you can see, this method can be highly effective in treating cases such as these. In the end, size of periapical lesion can affect prognosis, but it doesn’t have to.
